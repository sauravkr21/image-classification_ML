# Scratch That MLP

Welcome to Scratch That MLP! This project is focused on building a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) from scratch using the `numpy` library in Python.

## Features

- Implementation of a multi-layer perceptron using `numpy`
- Training of the MLP model on the CIFAR-10 dataset
- Comparison of the performance of the MLP model with other simple classifiers

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Numpy
- CIFAR-10 dataset
